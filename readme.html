<h2 id="technologiesframeworksandprogramminglanguagesuserfound">Technologies, Frameworks, and Programming Languages userFound</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Jade for HTML, Sass for CSS, Javascript - I liked Jade and Sass's simplicity. I used CodeKit as my compiler throughout the project.</li>
  <li>AngularJS, AngularRoutes, AngularCookies - frontend logic to push/pull data</li>
  <li>Express.js & Node.js - my backend, which houses the custom API built for this project which gives us three objects to us: request(req), response (res), and next.</li>
  <li>Mongoose/MongoDB - Mongoose gives a bit of structure to this NoSQL database, which stores the data collected.</li>
  <li>Stripe - the payment feature in this at checkout that allows the use of credit cards.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

<p>With this being one of my first full-stack projects, there was a lot to do and only so much time to do it. This really pushed me in ways of prioritizing and simplifying the problem.</p>

<h3 id="frontend">Frontend</h3>

<p>Getting familiar with Jade in this project was my top priority. I was introduced to it with a couple Express.js projects like my <a href="http://www.github.com/jttwnsnd/socket-chatroom">socket chatroom</a> and loved the simplicity of it. Though, getting used to how it's syntax worked is more understanding how to say it in Jade that what to say for my markup.</p>

<p>With Angular having data-binding, this was an obvious choice for the front-end. Ensuring that Angular knew everything going on in the backend first meant that I have to send everything to my backend from Angular. Inside my views that is bound through ng-view, provided by Angular Routes for an single page app, I would use ng-model in my HTML and reference it in my JS.</p>

<pre><code class="html">&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; ng-model=&quot;username&quot; placeholder=&quot;Enter Username&quot; min-length=&quot;4&quot; max-length=&quot;30&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot;/&gt;
</code></pre>
